  based on the data they input about their emissions. Though this gives individual companies visibility
  on their own emissions, it doesn't give us a clear idea on our progress on a regional level. This task
  addresses the other side of the problem; using consumption and production data on a federal state level
  to estimate the amount of GHG emissions over time.`;
